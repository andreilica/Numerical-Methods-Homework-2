Matlab homework

Task1 -> Creating a function that calculates the value of each polynomial from the series of polynomials P0(λ), P1(λ), P2(λ), ..., Pn(λ) for a real given λ value.

Task2 -> Creating a function used to determine the number of eigenvalues of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix which are smaller than a real given λ value.
 
Task3 -> Creating a function used to determine the lower and higher bounds of the eigenvalues of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix.

Task4 -> Creating a function used to separate the smallest 'm' eigenvalues of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix.

Task5 -> Creating a function used to determine with a certain precision the smallest 'm' eigenvalues of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix.

Task6 -> Creating a function that returns an eigenvalue and an eigenvector. The function is based on the inverse power method and on Thomas' algorithm to solve a system of linear equations, where the system matrix is a tridiagonal symmetric one.
